Biopunks are the visionaries whose imaginations were set on fire by the knowledge
that we had finally sequenced the human genome last year.
Biopunks get off on creative genetic engineering, RNA research, cloning and protein synthesis.
Biopunks hack genomic data, lining up human genomes next to mouse genomes to find out what the two species have in common and what they donâ€™t.
